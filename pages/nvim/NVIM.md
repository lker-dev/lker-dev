I really like being able to use a reliable text editor from the terminal it has obvious carry over when connecting to remote machines that just have cli text editors for options. nvim seems like a great choice with extra functionality on vim. This file tries to make help clear up what is needed to make using vim a pleasent experience whilst maintaining a minimalistic nvim dotfile configuration.

Markdown also seems the way to go with taking notes using nvim but with a raw vim setup essentially we need some customisation. 

Currently looking at customising the nvim markdown experience. 

Most suggestings including using a package manager to start adding plugins. But we are going to try to avoid that.

Plan is to clone forks of repos into `~/.config/nvim/pack/start/<function>/<package>`. And then import normally in init.lua as required. #TODO find good way to manage forks in github #TODO manage todo's from markdown
