I really like being able to use a reliable text editor from the terminal it has obvious carry over when connecting to remote machines that just have cli text editors for options. nvim seems like a great choice with extra functionality on vim. This file tries to make help clear up what is needed to make using vim a pleasent experience whilst maintaining a minimalistic nvim dotfile configuration.
